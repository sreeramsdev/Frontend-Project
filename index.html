            <h2>About The Legend</h2>
            <ul><br>
                <li>  A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
                    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
                    was born on October 15, 1931, in
                    Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.
               </li><br>
               
               <li>He served as the 11th President
                of India from 2002 to 2007.
</li><br>
<li>Kalam earned a degree in
    aeronautical engineering from the
    Madras Institute of Technology and in
    1958 joined the Defence Research and
    Development Organisation (DRDO).
</li><br>
<li>In 1969, he moved to the Indian
    Space Research Organisation, where he
    was project director of the SLV-III, the
    first satellite launch vehicle that was
    both designed and produced in India.
</li><br>
<li>Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
    Kalam planned the program that produced
    a number of successful missiles, which
    helped earn him the nickname 
        “Missile Man.”
</li><br>
<li> Among those successes
    was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
    ballistic missile, which incorporated
    aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
    in 1989.
</li><br>
<li>He also played a
    pivotal organisational, technical,
    and political role in India's Pokhran-II
    nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
    the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
</li><br>
<li> From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
    was scientific adviser to the defense
    minister, and he later served as principal
    scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
    government with the rank of cabinet minister.
</li><br>
<li> His prominent role in
    the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
    solidified India as a nuclear power and
    established Kalam as a national hero,
    although the tests caused great concern
    in the international community.
</li><br>
<li>In 1998 Kalam put
    forward a countrywide plan called
    Technology Vision 2020, which he described
    as a road map for transforming India from
    a less-developed to a developed society
    in 20 years. The plan called for, among
    other measures, increasing agricultural
    productivity, emphasizing technology as
    a vehicle for economic growth, and
    widening access to health care and
      education.</li>
